Your stats are private thing. No need to store them outside your server or give it for free! Wise Analytics is an advanced web traffic tracking and analytics plugin for WordPress sites.

== Description ==

**Wise Analytics** is a fully fledged site statistics plugin that helps to track the behavior of visitors, measure the traffic sources and actions taken on your website. The plugin provides a platform to analyze the traffic visualized as tables and charts. It is easy to set up and configure. Our development team is constantly working on new features and supporting the existing ones.

We believe that the statistics should be neither collected nor processed outside your server. With Wise Analytics you can have such level of privacy. Then you may learn your visitors and improve your site or business to earn more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to add more details to visitors (e.g. e-mail address, name, city, etc.) ? =

By default, visitors in Wise Analytics are described by ID number and a list of actions (called events) they performed on your site only.
If you want to add more details to the current visitor execute the following PHP code somewhere in your logic:

`
if (class_exists('\Kainex\WiseAnalytics\Container', false)) {
   $visitorsService = \Kainex\WiseAnalytics\Container::getInstance()->get(\Kainex\WiseAnalytics\Services\Users\VisitorsService::class);
   $visitor = $visitorsService->getOrCreate();
   $visitor->setFirstName("Jerry");
   $visitor->setLastName("Smith");
   $visitor->setEmail("jerry@example.pl");
   $visitorsService->save($visitor);
}
`
Next time you check Wise Analytics stats browser this visitor will be displayed as Jerry rather than Visitor #12345

= How to register a conversion? =

When a visitor does something significant on your site you may register a conversion event in your code.
Then the conversion is visible in the stats browser.

`
if (class_exists("\Kainex\WiseAnalytics\Container", false)) {
  $visitors = \Kainex\WiseAnalytics\Container::getInstance()->get(\Kainex\WiseAnalytics\Services\Users\VisitorsService::class);
  $events = \Kainex\WiseAnalytics\Container::getInstance()->get(\Kainex\WiseAnalytics\Services\Events\EventsService::class);

  $visitor = $visitors->getOrCreate();
  $visitor->setFirstName("John");
  $visitor->setEmail("john@myshop.com");
  $visitors->save($visitor);

  $events->createEvent(
    $visitor,
     "conversion", [
     "uri" => \Kainex\WiseAnalytics\Utils\URLUtils::getCurrentURL(),
     "ip" => \Kainex\WiseAnalytics\Utils\IPUtils::getIpAddress(),
     "order.id" => 123456,
     "order.id.public" => "order_123456",
     "order.amount" => 19900
    ]
  );
}
`

= How to tell Wise Analytics to add more details to visitors after they put more details (e.g. e-mail address) in other plugins? =

Imagine you have a contact form on your site. A visitor fills in the form and sends a message.
Together with the message they usually provide more details like a name, e-mail address, phone number, company name, etc.
Those details may be intercepted by Wise Analytics and then presented on a visitor's profile page in the stats browser.
This way you will learn more about your visitors: how often they come back, what exactly they do on your site, etc.

Go to Settings -> Wise Analytics -> Visitors and map all detected contact forms. Currently, we support Contact Form 7 plugin only. Once a visitor submits a form it is the recognized in Wise Analytics by name or e-mail (depending on mapping).
